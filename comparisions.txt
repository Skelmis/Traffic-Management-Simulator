When comparing our code for concept 1 & 3
Concept 1 being lights just rotate through clockwise
Concept 3 being based on lane length & wait times

I found that using a set ResetCars functions (I.E. generated 25 new cars every time)
Concept 1 had a total cars count of: 210 after 5 minutes
Concept 3 had a total cars count of: 285 after 5 minutes
This means Concept 3 had 75 more cars then Concept 1 are running for the same timeframe
This means Concept 3 is 135% more efficient then Concept 1

After about 15 minutes:
