When only turning on one light it didnt show the status of the other one
realised you needed to set red to True explicitly for it to show something

threadOne = threading.Thread(target=northController.OtherCycle)
if northRight < southOther:
    # south other should go
    threadTwo = threading.Thread(target=southController.OtherCycle)
else:
    # north right should go
    threadTwo = threading.Thread(target=northController.RightCycle)
threadOne.start()
threadTwo.start()
threadOne.join()
threadTwo.join()
The following code led to a race condition within the controller class so it was
changed to the following
if northController.GetOtherWait() > 3 or 1 == 1:
    # Means the left & straight cars need to go
    #threadOne = threading.Thread(target=northController.OtherCycle)
    if northRight < southOther:
        # south other should go
        threadTwo = threading.Thread(target=southController.OtherCycle)
        threadOne = threading.Thread(target=northController.OtherCycle)
        threadOne.start()
        threadTwo.start()
        threadOne.join()
        threadTwo.join()
    else:
        # north right should go
        thread = threading.Thread(target=northController.AllCycle)
        thread.start()
        thread.join()

This was later moved to a function and threading was not needed on the else
due to us only calling one class and no race conditions also no need for the
two different lights to be going at once since it was handled within one class


The Timer() function in simulator.py was 'broken' and didnt work as I thought it
was intended to, it never kicked out and exited n things so I made my own
using divmod to get hours, minutes and seconds
