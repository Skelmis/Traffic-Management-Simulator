"This will have the result of quickly increasing the efficiency of the intersection which has been degrading for the past five years. But hey, you might say. I don’t want to have to wait in line for 10 light rotations until everyone else has gone just because I was the only one travelling my ‘direction’! Well, this concept handles that as well. Featuring our custom wait system, you will not have to wait longer than a reasonable amount of time before getting a priority light status! Because no-one likes waiting at lights longer than they have to! This will also reduce the number of accidents that occur on the roads in Middlesbrook because the overall driver tension will be lower due to faster drive times *.
*When compared to other traffic light methods used by other cities."
